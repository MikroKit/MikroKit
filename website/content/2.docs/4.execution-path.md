title: Execution Path

# Execution Path

The `Execution Path` (or execution list) is a list of all the remote methods executes hooks that are executed during a route call.
That is: all hooks before the route, the route itself, and all hooks after the route.

For every incoming request the execution path is retrieved and all hooks and the route get executed in order.   

## Execution Order

::alert{type="info"}
The order in which [`Routes`](./1.routes.md) and [`Hooks`](./2.hooks.md) are added to the router is important.
<br/>
Hooks and Routes are executed in the same order they are defined (Top Down order)

```ts
import {Routes, initMionRouter, hook, route} from '@mionkit/router';

const routes = {
    authorizationHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
    users: {
        userOnlyHook: hook((): void => undefined), // scoped hook
        getUser: route((): null => null), // route
        setUser: route((): null => null), // route
    },
    pets: {
        getPet: route((): null => null), // route
        setPet: route((): null => null), // route
    },
    errorHandlerHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
    loggingHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
} satisfies Routes;

export const myValidApi = initMionRouter(routes);

```

### Hook's Scope

We can limit hooks to be executed only on a subset of routes.

The `userOnlyHook` from previous example will be executed **only** for the routes under `users` but not for routes under `pets`.

## Invalid Route Names

To guarantee the correct execution order, hooks and routes names CAN'T be numeric or digits only. You can read more about order of properties in JS objects [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525795/does-javascript-guarantee-object-property-order) and [here](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/property-order-is-predictable-in-javascript-objects-since-es2015/).

::alert{type="info"}
 An error is thrown when registering routes when invalid route names.

<!-- embedme ../../../packages/router/examples/invalid-definition-order.routes.ts -->
```ts
import {Routes, initMionRouter, hook, route} from '@mionkit/router';

const invalidRoutes = {
    authorizationHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
    1: {
        // Invalid naming !!!
        userOnlyHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
        getUser: route((): null => null), // route
    },
    '2': {
        // Invalid naming !!!
        getPet: route((): null => null), // route
    },
    errorHandlerHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
    loggingHook: hook((): void => undefined), // hook
} satisfies Routes;

// Throws an error as there are invalid route names
export const myInvalidApi = initMionRouter(invalidRoutes);

```
