# Request & Response

When making a `Route request` on top of the route's `url` we need to also pass the parameters in the json body (or header in case of [HeaderHooks](./2.hooks.md#header-hooks)). In order to be able to pass parameters for multiple hooks and the route itself, the json body is an object where keys are the route hook `id` and the values are `Arrays` containing the parameters in the same order as expected by the route or hook.

The `Route response` follows the same format were the key is the route or hook id and the values are the remote method response or a serialized [`RpcError`](./6.error-handling.md).

The reason for this format is to be able to send/receive data for multiple remote methods in a single request independently of which route has been called. *This architecture will allow combining multiple request on a single one for future version of the router*.

## Example

<!-- embedme ../../../../packages/router/examples/routes-definition.routes.ts -->
```ts
import {RouteDef, Routes} from '@mionkit/router';

// Defining a route as simple function
const sayHello = (ctx, name: string): string => {
    return `Hello ${name}.`;
}; // Satisfies Route

// Using a Route Definition object
const sayHello2 = {
    enableSerialization: false,
    enableValidation: false,
    // route handler
    route(ctx, name1: string, name2: string): string {
        return `Hello ${name1} and ${name2}.`;
    },
} satisfies RouteDef;

const routes = {
    sayHello,
    sayHello2,
} satisfies Routes;

```

| Request Path | Request Body                      | Response Body                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/sayHello`  | `{"sayHello": ["John"] }`         | `{"sayHello": "Hello John."}`          |
| `/sayHello2` | `{"sayHello2": ["Adan", "Eve"] }` | `{"sayHello2": "Hello Adan and Eve."}` |


## Native vs mion's Request & Response

The mion Request and Response objects available to every hook/route within the [`CallContext`](./3.call-context.md) are different from the underlying native request and response.
This is so mion can be used in different environments.

**In example:** [`@mionkit/http`](../2.http-server.md) uses native `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` from node.js while [`@mionkit/serverless`](../3.serverless.md) uses `APIGatewayEvent` and `APIGatewayProxyResult`, but the request and response object in the CallContext is the same independently of the environment mion is running.

## Type Reference

::mion-type{id="request"}
#name
Request
#code

mion's Request object, does not depends on the underlay native request.

<!-- embedme ../../../../packages/router/src/types.ts#L211-L218 -->
```ts
export type Request = {
    /** parsed headers */
    readonly headers: Readonly<AnyObject>;
    /** parsed body */
    readonly body: Readonly<AnyObject>;
    /** All errors thrown during the call are stored here so they can bee logged or handler by a some error handler hook */
    readonly internalErrors: Readonly<RpcError[]>;
};
```
::


::mion-type{id="response"}
#name
Response
#code

mion's Response object, does not depends on the underlay native response.

<!-- embedme ../../../../packages/router/src/types.ts#L227-L237 -->
```ts
export type Response = {
    readonly statusCode: number;
    /** response errors: empty if there were no errors during execution */
    readonly hasErrors: boolean;
    /** response headers */
    readonly headers: Headers;
    /** the router response data, body should not be modified manually so marked as Read Only */
    readonly body: Readonly<ResolvedPublicResponses>;
    /** json encoded response, contains data and errors if there are any. */
    readonly json: string;
};
```
::


::mion-type{id="raw-request"}
#name
RawRequest
#code

RawRequest is the minimal interface a native request must satisfy for mion to work correctly.

i.e: `IncomingMessage` from node.js does not have the `body` property but `@mionkit/http` takes care of the correct initialization before the request is passed to the mion's router.

<!-- embedme ../../../../packages/router/src/types.ts#L221-L224 -->
```ts
export type RawRequest = {
    headers: {[header: string]: string | undefined | string[]} | undefined;
    body: string | null | undefined | AnyObject;
};
```
