# Request & Response

The [MionRequest](#request) and [MionResponse](#response) objects are available to every hook/route within the [`CallContext`](./3.call-context.md) (the first parameter of every hook/route).

mion's request and response are different from the underlying native http request and response, so mion can be used seamlessly in different environments.

**Example:**    
[`@mionkit/http`](../3.platforms/1.node-js.md) uses node's native `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` while [`@mionkit/aws`](../3.platforms/3.aws-lambda.md) uses `APIGatewayEvent` and `APIGatewayProxyResult`. But routes and hooks will always receive a standard MionRequest & MionResponse.

**Quick Tip:**
<br>
Passing the correct parameters to routes and hooks is automatically managed by mion so accessing the Request and Response objects is not usually required.
<br>
Developers just need to take care of declaring the route/hook parameters and their types.

## How data is sent and received

When making a route call the `URL.path` is the route's id and is used for the route lookup. The HTTP request body is a JSON object where keys are the route or hook `ids` and the values are `Arrays` containing the parameters for each respective route or hook. This is done so multiple hooks or routes can be called in a single HTTP request.

The http response follows the same format where the body is a JSON object where the keys are the `ids` and the values are the responses from the remote methods.

::code-group
::code-block{label="Example" preview}
| Request Path | Request Body                      | Response Body                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/sayHello`  | `{"sayHello": ["John"] }`         | `{"sayHello": "Hello John."}`          |
| `/greetings` | `{"greetings": ["Adan", "Eve"] }` | `{"greetings": "Hello Adan and Eve."}` |

The reason for this format is to be able to send/receive data for multiple hooks and routes in a single HTTP request, independently of which route has been called.

<!-- embedme ../../../packages/router/examples/req-resp.routes.ts -->
```ts
import {Routes, route} from '@mionkit/router';

const routes = {
    sayHello: route((ctx, name: string): string => {
        return `Hello ${name}.`;
    }),
    greetings: route((ctx, name1: string, name2: string): string => {
        return `Hello ${name1} and ${name2}.`;
    }),
} satisfies Routes;

Please note all this logic of correctly formatting request & response data is handled transparently by the [Client](./4.client.md).

## Type Reference

::mion-type{id="request"}
#name
MionRequest
#code

mion's Request object, does not depend on the underlay native request.

<!-- embedme ../../../packages/router/src/types/context.ts#L31-L40 -->
```ts
export interface MionRequest {
    /** parsed headers */
    readonly headers: Readonly<MionHeaders>;
    /** json encoded request body. */
    readonly rawBody: string;
    /** parsed request body */
    readonly body: Readonly<AnyObject>;
    /** All errors thrown during the call are stored here so they can bee logged or handler by a some error handler hook */
    readonly internalErrors: Readonly<RpcError[]>;
}
```
::


::mion-type{id="response"}
#name
MionResponse
#code

mion's Response object, does not depend on the underlay native response.

<!-- embedme ../../../packages/router/src/types/context.ts#L43-L54 -->
```ts
export interface MionResponse {
    /** response http status code */
    readonly statusCode: number;
    /** response headers */
    readonly headers: Readonly<MionHeaders>;
    /** json encoded response body, filled only after all routes/hook has ben finalized. */
    readonly rawBody: string;
    /** the router response data, body should not be modified manually so marked as Read Only */
    readonly body: Readonly<PublicResponses>;
    /** response errors: empty if there were no errors during execution */
    readonly hasErrors: boolean;
}
```
::


::mion-type{id="mion-header"}
#name
MionHeaders
#code

mion's headers object, does not depend on the underlay native response.

Similar to the Headers [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers){blank}

<!-- embedme ../../../packages/router/src/types/context.ts#L60-L69 -->
```ts
export interface MionHeaders {
    append(name: string, value: HeaderValue): void;
    delete(name: string): void;
    set(name: string, value: HeaderValue): void;
    get(name: string): HeaderValue | undefined | null;
    has(name: string): boolean;
    entries(): IterableIterator<[string, HeaderValue]>;
    keys(): IterableIterator<string>;
    values(): IterableIterator<HeaderValue>;
}
```
