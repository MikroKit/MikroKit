# Update User Benchmarks

::alert{type="success"}
This **Update User** benchmark compares validation and serialization on top of routing performance.
::

These benchmarks are based on the [fastify benchmarks](https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks){target="_blank"} repo! in fact our goal is to perform similar to fastify as we considered it the industry standard in terms of performance.

mion is focused on being lightweight and fast so it can be run in serverless environments. We run the benchmarks before every PR gets merged to ensure there is no performance regression.

Please always take benchmarks as general guidelines as you might obtain different results in your real world application. we just run the benchmarks to ensure there is no performance degradation when new features/fixes are added to mion.


## What is tested?

The test consist of an `updateUser` request where the fields of the user must be deserialized and validated and response must be serialized.

The `lastUpdate` field is a date that must be transformed into a JS `Date` (deserialized) and validated, then a month is added to the Date and the updated user is send back in the response.

```ts
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  surname: string;
  lastUpdate: Date;
}

// ### mion ###
// the received user by the route is already validated and deserialized
// user.lastUpdate is already a js date instead and string (result of JSON.parse)
const routes = {
  updateUser: (ctx, user: User): User => {
    user.lastUpdate.setMonth(user.lastUpdate.getMonth() + 1);
    return user;
  },
} satisfies Routes;

// ### Express ###
// A plugin must be used to parse the json body
// validation must be done manually and user.lastUpdate must be deserialized manually into a date
// in this case developer would have to manually write `isUser` and `deserializeUser` functions. (check src code fo those functions)
app.post('/updateUser', function (req, res) {
  const rawUser = req.body?.updateUser;
  if (!isUser(rawUser)) throw 'app error, invalid parameter, not a user';
  const user = deserializeUser(rawUser);
  user.lastUpdate.setMonth(user.lastUpdate.getMonth() + 1);
  res.json(user);
});
```

### Notes

We can observe how in this benchmark the requests takes considerably more time compared with the hello world benchmark. This is mostly because each request is spending extra time on validation and serialization.
