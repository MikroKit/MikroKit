# Hello Benchmarks

These benchmarks are based on the [fastify benchmarks](https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks){target="_blank"} repo! in fact our goal is to perform similar to fastify as we considered it the industry standard in terms of performance.

mion is focused on being lightweight and fast so it can be run in serverless environments. We run the benchmarks before every PR gets merged to ensure there is no performance regression.

Please always take benchmarks as general guidelines as you might obtain different results in your real world application. we just run the benchmarks to ensure there is no performance degradation when new features/fixes are added to mion.


## What is tested?

::alert{type="success"}
This **Hello World** benchmark involves mostly routing as there is no validation.
::

This is a simple hello world scenario, is a good indicator of the router performance and theoretical upper limit of each framework.

```ts
// ### mion ###
export const routes = {
  sayHello: (): string => ({hello: "world"}),
} satisfies Routes;

// ### Express ###
app.get("/sayHello", function (req, res) {
  res.json({ hello: "world" });
});
```

### Notes


Please note mion creates standard Request, Response & Headers Object for each request so it can be used cross platform. This can result in slightly less performance compared to fastify in node.js environments only.
