## Full Client-Server integration

The biggest advantage of using Javascript or Typescript Backends might be the option to reuse/share some code with the Frontend.

The so called [Isomorphic Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript) can get complicated but there is an area were it shines. This is **Sharing the Types!**

This kind of integration is not possible if the client and the server are not written in the same language and are fully typed.

## Runtime Types

Having Typescript types available at runtime is a game changer and opens a new set of functionalities, in the case of mion automatic serialization and validation.

We need to thank the amazing work done by [@deepkit](https://docs.deepkit.io/english/runtime-types.html){target="_blank"} to provide types at runtime as it is not an easy task!

We also investigated another options during development and deepkit was the most robust and flexible!
