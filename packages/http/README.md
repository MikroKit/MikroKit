# `@mikrokit/http`

**MikroKit router is an RPC like router oriented for quick Api development,** it is agnostic about the environment it is used on. It could be used on [serverless environments](../serverless/README.md), or as an standalone http server.

**MikroKit Server is well suited a very specific scenario, that is Apis that works with json data only**. In return it offers quick development, fast execution and a Lightweight router ðŸš€.

This is a limited http server, only supports `application/json` content type, does not support multipart/form-data, no websocket or streams and no file upload neither. There are better alternatives for those scenarios (like S3 file upload, etc).

## `RPC like router`

MikroKit router uses a **Remote Procedure Call** style routing, unlike traditional routers it does not use `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` methods, everything is transmitted using `HTTP POST` method and all data is sent/received in the request/response `body` and `headers`.

### Requests & Responses

- Requests are made using only `HTTP POST` method.
- Data is sent and received only in the `body` and `headers`.
- Data is sent and received only in `JSON` format.

## `Routing`

ðŸš€ Lightweight router **_based in plain javascript objects_**.

Thanks to it's RPC style there is no need to parse parameters or regular expressions when finding a route. Just a simple [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) in memory containing all the routes.

`Route parameters` are passed as an array in the request body, in a field with the same name as the route. Elements in the array must have the same order as the function parameters.

`Route response` is send back in the body in a field with the same name as the route.

The reason for this weird naming is to future proof the router to be able to accept multiple routes on a single request. However this can be changed setting the `routeFieldName` in the router options.

### ðŸ“š [Please read full router documentation here!](./packages/router/README.md)

```js
// ../router/examples/routes-definition.ts

import {Route, Handler, Routes, MkRouter} from '@mikrokit/router';

const sayHello: Handler = (context, name: string) => {
  return `Hello ${name}.`;
};

const sayHello2: Route = {
  route(context, name1: string, name2: string) {
    return `Hello ${name1} and ${name2}.`;
  },
};

const routes: Routes = {
  sayHello, // api/sayHello
  sayHello2, // api/sayHello2
};

MkRouter.setRouterOptions({prefix: 'api/'});
MkRouter.addRoutes(routes);
```
