Runtime Types
#description
mion uses [Deepkit's runtime types](https://docs.deepkit.io/english/runtime-types.html) for automatic validation and serialization.
When typescript gets compiled extra bytecode is generated containing type metadata that can be accessed at runtime.

## RPC <sup>(Like)</sup> vs  REST

::alert
We use the term **RPC Like** to highlight that mion does not use a rpc or custom protocol, it operates over HTTP yet it uses an RPC style routing.    
::

Advantages of an RPC architecture:
::list{type="success"}
- Type Safety
- Less abstractions
- Better client-server integration
