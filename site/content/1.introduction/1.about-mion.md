# Typescript Apis at the speed of light ðŸš€


mion is a lightweight TypeScript-based framework designed for building serverless APIs. It aims to provide a great developer experience and is optimized for serverless environments. With mion, you can quickly build APIs that are type-safe, with automatic validation and serialization out of the box.

## Why Another Framework?

Serverless applications have different requirements compared to conventional server apps and there are not many frameworks that offer type-safe APIs with automatic validation and serialization by default.

mion addresses these challenges by offering a lightweight and opinionated framework focused on simplicity and developer experience.

## RPC Like

mion is designed with a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) style and works exclusively with JSON data. The framework prioritizes quick development, fast startups, and minimal abstractions. It follows a convention-over-configuration approach and focuses on performance and developer experience.

## Fast

We have prioritized and tracked performance during the development of the framework, we even have many discarded features and experiments when there was a performance degradation compared to previous versions. Our goal is to have similar performance to fastify which we consider the gold standard in node.js frameworks!

For full benchmarks and comparison against other frameworks please visit the [benchmarks repo](https://github.com/MionKit/Benchmarks).

 We Know! benchmarks are just benchmarks, but if you don't keep performance in check you end up like Internet Explorer!

## Routing

mion's router is lightweight and fast. Unlike traditional routers, it uses a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) style of routing. The Http method is not relevant, there are no parameters in the Url and data is sent and received in JSON format via the request body or headers. mion's router leverages a simple in-memory map for route lookup, making it extremely fast.

Apis are composed of Routes and Hooks. Routes are methods that can be called remotely from the client and have an specific url, while hooks are auxiliary methods that get's executed before or after a route.

To learn more about the router, refer to the [Router Documentation](./packages/router/).

## Automatic Serialization & Validation

mion utilizes [Deepkit's runtime types](https://deepkit.io/) for automatic validation and serialization. Deepkit's magic enables type information to be available at runtime, allowing for automatic validation and serialization of data.

By leveraging runtime types, mion offers advanced capabilities such as request validation and response/request serialization that typically involves using multiple framework and loads of code or boilerplate to be manually written by developers.
