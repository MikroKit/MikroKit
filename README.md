# mion : Typescript Apis at the speed of light üöÄ

mion is a lightweight TypeScript-based framework designed for building serverless APIs. It aims to provide a great developer experience and is optimized for serverless environments. With mion, you can quickly build APIs that are type-safe, with automatic validation and serialization out of the box.

## Why Another Framework?

Serverless applications have different requirements compared to conventional server apps.
There are not many frameworks that offer type-safe APIs with automatic validation and serialization by default.
mion addresses these challenges by offering a lightweight and opinionated framework focused on simplicity and developer experience.

## Features

| Status | Name                        | Description                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ     | RPC-like Router             | Provides an RPC-style router for handling API requests        |
| ‚úÖ     | Automatic Validation        | Automatically validates data received by the API              |
| ‚úÖ     | Automatic Serialization     | Automatically serializes data sent by the API                 |
| ‚úÖ     | AWS Lambda Handler          | Seamless integration with AWS Lambda for serverless execution |
| ‚úÖ     | HTTP Server                 | Includes an HTTP server module for handling API requests      |
| ‚úÖ     | Automatic TypeScript Client | Fully typed client without need of compilation                |

## Opinionated Approach

mion is designed for RPC style APIs that work exclusively with JSON. The framework prioritizes quick development, fast startups, and minimal abstractions. It follows a convention-over-configuration approach and focuses on performance and developer experience.

## Routing

mion's router is lightweight and fast. Unlike traditional routers, it uses a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) style of routing. The HTTP method is not relevant, and data is sent and received in JSON format via the request body or headers. mion's router leverages a simple in-memory map for route lookup, making it extremely fast.

Apis are composed of Routes and Hooks. Routes are methods that can be called remotely from the client and have an specific url, while hooks are auxiliary methods that get's executed before or after a route.

To learn more about the router, refer to the [Router Documentation](./packages/router/).

## Automatic Serialization & Validation

mion utilizes [Deepkit's runtime types](https://deepkit.io/) for automatic validation and serialization. Deepkit's magic enables type information to be available at runtime, allowing for automatic validation and serialization of data.

By leveraging runtime types, mion offers advanced capabilities such as request validation and response/request serialization that topically involves using more than one framework. Please consult Deepkit's documentation for installation instructions and more information on these features.

## Type Safe Apis

Thats it üëÜ, thats all you need to write a Fully Type Safe Api and Client &nbsp; üöÄ

## Quick Start

#### Server Side

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @deepkit/type-compiler
npm install @mionkit/router
```

Depending if you using the server or serverless version

```bash
# http server
npm install @mionkit/http

# serverless
npm install @mionkit/serverless
```

Set up Deepkit runtime types by enabling reflection in your tsconfig.json file. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Deepkit Runtime Types Installation](https://docs.deepkit.io/english/runtime-types.html#runtime-types-installation) guide.

Write your Api:

```ts
// packages/client/examples/server.routes.ts

import {RpcError} from '@mionkit/core';
import {Routes, registerRoutes} from '@mionkit/router';
import {clientRoutes} from '@mionkit/common';
import {initAwsLambdaRouter} from '@mionkit/serverless';
import {Logger} from 'Logger';

export type User = {id: string; name: string; surname: string};
export type Order = {id: string; date: Date; userId: string; totalUSD: number};

const routes = {
    auth: {
        headerName: 'authorization',
        headerHook: (ctx, token: string): void => {
            if (!token) throw new RpcError({statusCode: 401, message: 'Not Authorized', name: ' Not Authorized'});
        },
    },
    users: {
        getById: (ctx, id: string): User => ({id, name: 'John', surname: 'Smith'}),
        delete: (ctx, id: string): string => id,
        create: (ctx, user: Omit<User, 'id'>): User => ({id: 'USER-123', ...user}),
    },
    orders: {
        getById: (ctx, id: string): Order => ({id, date: new Date(), userId: 'USER-123', totalUSD: 120}),
        delete: (ctx, id: string): string => id,
        create: (ctx, order: Omit<Order, 'id'>): Order => ({id: 'ORDER-123', ...order}),
    },
    utils: {
        sum: (ctx, a: number, b: number): number => a + b,
        sayHello: (ctx, user: User): string => `Hello ${user.name} ${user.surname}`,
    },
    log: {
        forceRunOnError: true,
        hook: (ctx): any => {
            Logger.log(ctx.path, ctx.request.headers, ctx.request.body);
        },
    },
} satisfies Routes;

// init serverless router
initAwsLambdaRouter();
// use initHttpRouter(...); for regular nodejs serve

// register routes and exporting the type of the Api to be used by client
const myApi = registerRoutes(routes);
export type MyApi = typeof myApi;

// register routes required by client
// these routes serve metadata, for validation and serialization on the client
registerRoutes(clientRoutes);

```

#### Client Side

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @mionkit/client
```

Use your Api:

```ts
// packages/client/examples/client.ts

import {initClient} from '@mionkit/client';

// importing type only from server
import type {MyApi} from './server.routes';
import {ParamsValidationResponse} from '@mionkit/reflection';

const port = 8076;
const baseURL = `http://localhost:${port}`;
const {methods, client} = initClient<MyApi>({baseURL});

// prefills the token for any future requests, value is stored in localStorage
await methods.auth('myToken-XYZ').prefill();

// calls sayHello route in the server
const sayHello = await methods.utils.sayHello({id: '123', name: 'John', surname: 'Doe'}).call();
console.log(sayHello); // Hello John Doe

// calls sumTwo route in the server
const sumTwoResp = await methods.utils.sum(5, 2).call();
console.log(sumTwoResp); // 7

// validate parameters locally without calling the server
const validationResp: ParamsValidationResponse = await methods.utils
    .sayHello({id: '123', name: 'John', surname: 'Doe'})
    .validate();
console.log(validationResp); // {hasErrors: false, totalErrors: 0, errors: []}

```

## Contributing

Contributors and maintainers are welcome üëç

Mion's philosophy is simplicity, so we don't want to add many features or abstractions, as an open source project we want to keep tha features we have to maintain to a minimum, that said contributions to mion are encouraged! Please open issues and submit pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes.

The project is organized as a monorepo using npm workspaces, NX, and Lerna. Each package within the monorepo is compiled and tested individually using TypeScript and Jest.
